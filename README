Port Center
-----------

The port center (pc) is an OS directory that contains a few Bash Scripts and Make Files, which can help one install open source developer tools on a Mac; formerly OS X, now macOS.

The Port Center automates also the installation of RPM, a package management system which however requires a long list of dependencies to be installed on macOS Sierra (10.12). In the past I'd tested it also in OS X Yosemite (10.10). Once the RPM is installed, one can use in the port script the command line arguments "rpmbuild" and "rpminstall" instead of "archive" and "install" respectively for any open source package. To see more type: "~/pc/port --help"

Also, one can run this script in a RHEL 7.4 compatible system to install two Linux Drivers, one for the Apple USB Super Drive (ausden) and a second for the Broadcom IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi card (bcm43xx) installed in older Mac Computers (ie a Mac Mini 2011). The WiFi Driver is kernel specific and has to be reinstalled after a kernel upgrade. 


Installation Script
-------------------

To install a package, one has to run the "port" command to create an archive that will be processed by the system installer. This "port" command cannot uninstall packages and shouldn't be on the path.

The installation process is logically divided in three phases. At first, one can run the command "./port details <package>" to examine in advance the installation details of a package, without download it; this command will print the relevant url's, configuration options, and installation paths for that package.

After, one can archive a package with a single command or on a step-by-step basis. Specifically, one can download, extract, patch, configure, make, place, pack, and archive a package. These steps are also options of the port command. Running the "port" command with the option "place" will install files to a temporary directory located at "/tmp/<package>.dst"; which is the destination root that will be packed and archived.

Finally, one can invoke the system installer to process the archive; possibly, by double clicking it. If you build and install a package on the same machine you can simply run: "./port install <package>". 

The file pc2gfortran.spec provides instructions to help you transfer the Fortran patches to a Source RPM for a Linux installation.


Download & Setup
----------------

Once the tarball has been downloaded (ie at ~/Downloads/pc-rules-2017-11-09.tar.bz2), the following four commands will setup the port center:

install -d ~/pc 
cd ~/pc 
tar -xjSf ~/Downloads/pc-rules-2017-11-09.tar.bz2 
ln -sf rules/port port

*SHA1   70dbdec0d9bc806cc5721b3187ceb1d7b6477fa8 
To see ie the build instructions for gcc-4.8, type:

./port details gcc4

Likely, this is the first package to be installed in macOS (10.12). In a Linux system try the package gcc48 instead. 


RPM (4.11.3)
------------

[2017-04-10]
The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management system used in various Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise. According to wikipedia, it has also been ported to other systems such as IBM's AIX .

This package builds the fork distributed by rpm.org and now uses gnupg-2.0. This porting is still work in progress and hasn't passed yet adequate quality tests. In example, we haven't tested at all the RPM Plug-In functionality. If you face any problems with the Berkeley DataBase, configure it with the minimum options possible.

To install this package and initialize the RPM DataBase, run:

./port --nosudo install rpm

If everything works as supposed to, a "postinstall" script will also initialize the RPM DataBase and populate it with all the packages installed by the Port Center along with any other JRE and JDK installed in your system. If not restricted by the SandBox it will attempt to process XQuartz also, otherwise one can run it manually on a later phase. These packages will go under the full control of RPM, you can uninstall them.

The "postinstall" script will also run the "vpkg-provides.sh" script that creates a virtual package for all the libraries installed at /usr/lib. Further, all Frameworks in System Library are added as capabilities that the system provides.

If everything has indeed worked as supposed to, you should be able to install easily at least a small RPM package, ie gnu sed.

Below there are step by step instructions to download this small RPM package (sed-4.2.2-5) from public-yum.oracle.com and install it on an Mac OS Sierra (10.12).


Download a source RPM Package
-----------------------------
cd ~/Downloads 
curl -O http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL7/latest/x86_64/getPackageSource/sed-4.2.2-5.el7.src.rpm 
rpm -i sed-4.2.2-5.el7.src.rpm 
 

The above command is not supposed to complain at all about signature problems, but you will likely see and it is safe to ignore the following two recurring warnings.

warning: user mockbuild does not exist - using root 
warning: group mockbuild does not exist - using root 
 

In case you see a warning about the signature, run:
sudo rpm --import /usr/local/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle-ol7


Porting a source RPM package to Mac OS Sierra (10.12)
-----------------------------------------------------
cd $HOME/rpmbuild 
sed -i.sav "s/, [ ]*libselinux-devel//g" SPECS/sed.spec 
sed -i.sav "s,/sbin/install-info,/usr/local/bin/install-info,g" SPECS/sed.spec 
sed -i.sav "s/configure[ ]*--without-included-regex/configure --disable-nls --disable-i18n --with-included-regex/g" SPECS/sed.spec 
sed -i.sav "s/sed.info.gz/sed.info/g" SPECS/sed.spec
sed -i.sav "s/%find_lang/#%find_lang/g" SPECS/sed.spec
sed -i.sav "s/\-f[ ]*%{name}.lang//g" SPECS/sed.spec  
rm -f SPECS/sed.spec.sav


Build & Install an RPM Package
------------------------------
cd $HOME/rpmbuild 
rpmbuild -ba SPECS/sed.spec --target x86_64 
sudo rpm -i RPMS/X86_64/sed-4.2.2-5.x86_64.rpm


Uninstall an RPM Package
------------------------
Thereafter, one should be able to uninstall this package, which hasn't any active dependents, with the following command:

sudo rpm --erase sed-4.2.2-5

Since various RPM Scripts depend on gnu sed, one will definitely reinstall it. Once "autogen" is also installed one can make a complete check on gcc4 (make check), because the gcc-4.8.5 sub-package "fixincludes" depends on both of them.


Epilogue
--------
Obviously, one can copy paste and execute the above commands in a Mac, as long as Oracle Linux version 7.3 uses this version of sed. Without any doubt, the RPM installation still needs fine tuning (no mock, rpmlint, and so on) and probably this package isn't representative of the effort needed to port a package to OS X. Many RPM Source Packages require actual patch files to build on a Mac. Once "gnu sed" is installed, one should be able to install without any modifications "byacc", a prerequisite of "gnu awk", which in turn requires some path adjustments, ie /sbin and /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin.

Once you have installed these source RPM packages, you can install "autogen" with the following command:
 ~/pc/port --force rpminstall autogen 


Known Issues
------------
[2017-11-07]

- The installation script should run immediately after you clean install macOS Sierra along
  with the Command Line Tools and optionally Xcode. Any other packages on path (ie at /opt/local)
  might have undesirable side effects; a similar restriction applies to Linux as well. This 
  is the only scenario I've successfully tested so far. 

- To install gcc48 or gcc4 in Linux, you have to manually install its dependencies. The 
  required dependencies in a RHEL 7.3 system can be satisfied by the official distribution
  packages. So, the PC won't attempt to install ie gettext or pkg-config.

  Although the PlugIn facilitates debugging for Fortran programs in Xcode (which uses only
  LLDB), I've not tested it exhaustively. Yet, it can overcome few problems mainly on a
  Mac, like ie the test failure of pr49866.c (PLTOFF isn't acceptable by newer mac linkers).
  
  GNU gcc-4.8.5 can't parse some system headers in macOS Sierra. One test case (include.c) 
  has been adjusted as in gcc-7.1 but another indicative failure is this:
  FAIL: gcc.dg/framework-1.c (test for excess errors)

  The above problem has been classified as an enhancement request (69960). In 10.13, gcc4 might
  issue in addition a warning, whereas gcc7 complaints only for a non constant assignment. 

  There are some failures with the "guality" tests in Linux (gcc.dg/quality/) whereas on a
  Mac the PCH tests have been adjusted to run without warnings & core dumps. One of
  the warnings ie didn't comply with a system security policy that loads processes at 
  randomly chosen memory addresses; I could avoid it only in the Xcode environment.

- Too many test cases of "valgrind" fail on a mac, ie 73 of the 215 "memcheck" tests fail.
  Whereas the ratio of the failures is worse when one runs all the tests: 
  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365327#c23

- If bash is asked to run a non existing command, you might face an unimportant Segmentation 
  Fault. This problem, which appeared in Sierra, remains even with the newer patches applied
  on 2017-10-02. Perhaps, some Linux specific patches should be skipped on Darwin. 

  In macOS High Sierra (10.13), the read builtin command fails to process some strings. The
  "port" script depends on that functionality.

- The GNU tar-1.26 command (tar) might complain for unknown "header keywords" if the pc 
  "tarball" has been compressed by the BSD tar command (bsdtar). I always ignore these messages.
 
- The installation script *IS NOT* ready for macOS High Sierra (10.13).
